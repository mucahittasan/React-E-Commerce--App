<h2> ‚ú® About The Project</h2>

- <p>In this project, I tried to make an e-commerce site using the react library. When you first enter the site, a home page will welcome you and you can see all the products on this home page. If you want, you can filter the products by clicking one of the options in the header field. To add a desired product to the cart, you can press the add to cart button and send it to the cart. To see your products in the basket, you can click on the basket icon and see your products in the basket. You can increase or decrease the amount of products in the basket. You can confirm the items in your cart by clicking confirm cart.
</p>
  
 - <p>I used React Js, Context Api, React Hooks and Scss technologies while doing this project.</p>
 - <p>Made responsively using media queries</p>
